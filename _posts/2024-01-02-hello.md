# Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning
In this post I will give a brief rundown of Reinforcement Learning, before going in Multi-Agent setting of the same.

Deep Reinforcement Learning is dofficult to get into due to the sheer number of fields it contains, which are
- Deep learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Desing of the Environment and the reward function

## Getting Started
I will try to break down the topic in small portions and focus on each thing separately and then finally combine them and discuss how they play with each other.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner isnt told what to do, rather *explores* the environment by itself. One action doesnt only affect current reward but also affects whats the next situation and hence all *future rewards*. These are two characteristics features of RL - delayed reward and exploration.

The underlying mathematical concept of RL is Markov Decision Chains.
